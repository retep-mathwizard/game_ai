    Of course, this game uses numbers instead. When you start the round, a series of numbers will appear, with a letter beside it to tell
    sequences apart. You will input the sequence of numbers that appears, and if you get it right, you will proceed to the next round.
    Remember, it just adds a number on, so you don't have to memorize an entirely new sequence every time!

    Press r to reprint the level
    Press s to add a 10th of a second
    Press f to remove a 10th of a second
    Press a to add a number per iteration (2 numbers at once added, etc.)
    Press x to remove a number per iteration
